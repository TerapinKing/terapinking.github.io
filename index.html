    <div class="text"> <strong>You can keep in touch with me at</br>
    <strong>ftheodoreelliott[at]proton.me</strong></br>
    </br>
    I always love hearing from other creatives and film fans so keep in touch and let me know what you're up to.</br>
    I'll be sending updates via e-mail rather than social media or anything moving forward so get in tocuh</br>
    and I'll keep you in the loop with upcoming events, talks, and my general ramblings.</br>
    </br>
    Feel free to send me anything you'd like me to share with others; be it films, events, essays, whatever.</br>
    </br>
    The future will take place in public places, not on the internet.</br>
    I'd love to see you there</br>
    </br>
    Keep flying the flag.</br>
